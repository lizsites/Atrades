# Nomenklatura
Board Game prototyping for a socialism-themed area control game.

Players will assume the roles of influential nobles and elites that ran the enterprises of the Soviet Union. As these Nomenklatura, players will bid for turn order, select actions in the auctioned turn order, and take potentially powerful enterprise actions. At the end of the round, players will earn rubles depending on how much influence they have in each of the eight areas.

The end of the game is triggered at the end of the 10th round, and the player with the most rubles wins the game.


## Rules of play

A round of Nomenklatura is played in four phases:
1. Turn Order Phase
2. Executive Phase
3. Enterprise Phase
4. Shipping Phase
