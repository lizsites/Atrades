# Nomenklatura
Board Game prototyping for a socialism-themed area control game.

Players will assume the roles of influential nobles and elites that ran the enterprises of the Soviet Union. As these Nomenklatura, players will bid for turn order, select actions in the auctioned turn order, and take potentially powerful enterprise actions. At the end of the round, players will earn rubles depending on how much influence they have in each of the eight areas.

The player with the most rubles at the end of the 10th round is deemed the most likely to influence russian politics after the collapse of the USSR, and is therefore the winner.


## Rules of play

A round of Nomenklatura is played in four phases:
1. Agenda Phase
2. Execution Phase
3. Consolidation Phase
4. Shipping Phase


# Agenda Phase

During the Agenda phase, players will receive formal orders from Moscow on how to sculpt the industry Soviet Union. These policies and commands come in the form of action cards that will describe the actions a player will take when selecting it during the Executive phase. Then players will pay each other 

Discard any action cards leftover from the previous round. Then re-fill the agenda by flipping over cards from the agenda deck and placing them at the top of the board. The amount of cards that will be flipped over during this round is  1 plus the amount of players, so that even that the last player to take an action will two options.

After re-filling the agenda, players will bid for turn order. This is done by bidding an amount of rubles greater than the previous bid and devoting that amount to the bidding track. When you devote rubles to the bidding track, you will start with the player space to the right of the the last ruble placed by the player who bid before you. You will place one ruble in that player space, place another ruble to the right of that player space, and continue to place rubles in this fashion until you have devoted an amount of rubles equal to your declared bid. 

You can and will place rubles in your own space during this process. You will only places rubles in player spaces where there are active players, exa. only use players spaces 1,2, and 3 if you are playing with three players. If you come to the rightmost player space, and still have remaining rubles to devote, you will continue at the leftmost spot of the bidding track.

Bidding will start with the current turn order that was determined during the preevious rounds agenda phase, until all players but one have refused to raise the current bid. If a player is starting the bid, they will place the first ruple to the right of their player space, e.g. if player 2 was the first player in turn order for bidding, they would start by placing their first ruple on the player 3 space.

Turn order for players is then decided from greatest bid to smallest. For example, if player 2 won at 8 rubles, a player 3 passed after bidding 7 rubles, and the the player 1 did not bid at all, then the turn order would be player 2, 3, then 1. players will place player marker in the turn order track to reflect the new turn order with the player with the winning bid placing their marker in the 1 spot, second highest placing in 2, etc.

In addition, each player takes the rubles that were placed on their designated space during the agenda phase, and use them normally as their own rubles for the remainder of the game for bidding on the bidding track and scoring at the end of the game.


# Execution phase

During the Execution phase, players will in turn order select and execute agenda cards. These agenda cards will describe the actions that the player will take. After taking the action, the agenda card will then be discarded.

Each player will take exactly one agenda cards and perform the described action(s) in turn order. 

After everyone has taken an action, there should be one agenda card leftover that will be discarded during the proceeding Agenda phase.
